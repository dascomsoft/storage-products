📦 DomShop – Inventory Management App for Small Businesses in Cameroon 🇨🇲


 DomShop is a simple yet powerful inventory management web application designed to help small street businesses in Cameroon control their stock of goods effectively and with ease.



### 🧠 Project Description

Many small businesses in Cameroon face daily challenges when it comes to managing their inventory—leading to overstocking, stockouts, and loss of sales data. **DomShop** was created as a lightweight digital solution to allow these entrepreneurs to:

* Keep track of available stock.
* Record product sales.
* Avoid losses due to poor inventory visibility.
* Gain digital control over physical goods—even without internet connection (data saved locally for now).

This project is a step toward **empowering informal businesses** by providing a **user-friendly** and **offline-capable** digital tool.



⚙️ Tech Stack

* **React.js** – Front-end JavaScript library for building UI.
* **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
* **Vite** – Fast development server and build tool.
* **JavaScript (ES6)** – For application logic.
* **LocalStorage API** – To persist user data across sessions (temporary database).
* **Figma (optional)** – For future UI/UX designs and prototyping.


### ✅ Features Implemented

* 📥 **Add Products:** Add a new product with name and quantity.
* 📦 **View Product List:** All added products are displayed in a responsive grid layout.
* 🔻 **Sell Products:** Click "Vendre" to reduce product stock by 1.
* 🗑️ **Delete Products:** Remove a product entirely from inventory.
* 🕓 **Sales History:** View list of sales with timestamps.
* 💾 **Persistent Data:** Inventory and sales are saved locally (even after page reloads).


 🚀 Planned Features (coming soon)

* 🔐 User Authentication (admin access only).
* ☁️ Cloud Database Integration (Firebase or Supabase).
* 📈 Dashboard for sales reports and analytics.
* 📱 Mobile Responsiveness for all screen sizes.
* 🧾 Product Categories and Price Management.
* 🧠 Smart Restock Reminders via notifications.
* 🌐 Multilingual Interface (French / English).
* 📡 Cloud sync for remote access.


3. Run the app locally

### 💡 How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

* When a user adds a product, it's stored in **React state** and then saved to **localStorage**.
* When a product is sold, its quantity is reduced, and a record is added to the **sales history**.
* Everything persists locally, so even if you refresh the page or restart your browser, your data stays intact.


### 🌍 Target Audience

* Small business owners in Cameroon (boutiques, kiosks, street vendors).
* Users with low technical literacy.
* Businesses with no internet connection.



### 🤝 Contributions
