📦 DomShop – Inventory Management App for Small Businesses in Cameroon 🇨🇲
DomShop is a simple yet powerful inventory management web application designed to help small street businesses in Cameroon control their stock of goods effectively and with ease.

🧠 Project Description
Many small businesses in Cameroon face daily challenges when it comes to managing their inventory—leading to overstocking, stockouts, and loss of sales data. DomShop was created as a lightweight digital solution to allow these entrepreneurs to:

✅ Keep track of available stock.

✅ Record product sales.

✅ Avoid losses due to poor inventory visibility.

✅ Gain digital control over physical goods—with offline-first design (data saved locally when offline, synced to cloud when online).

This project is a step toward empowering informal businesses by providing a user-friendly, offline-capable, and cloud-backed digital tool.
